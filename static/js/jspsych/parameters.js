 * How to use HTML tags guide
 * 
 * Text formatting:
 * <p>This is some text</p> - defines a paragraph.
 * <b>This is some bold text</b> - Bold text
 * <i>This is some italic text</i> - Italic text
 * This is some text before the line break <br> - produces a line break in the text (carriage-return). 
 * <br> is independent tag and not require adding closing tag like this </br>
 * <span style="color: red;">This is some formatted text</span> - tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
 * Heading tag: It is used to define the heading of HTML document.
 * <h1>Heading 1 </h1>   
 * <h2>Heading 2 </h2> 
 * <h3>Heading 3 </h3>  
 * <h4>Heading 4 </h4>  
 * <h5>Heading 5 </h5>  
 * <h6>Heading 6 </h6> 
 * 
 * Above, I gave a list of the most common HTML tags used for formatting text.
 * There are a lot of other HTML tags more information about you can find here https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp
